Maria was phenomenal from the first meeting, always attentive, never judgmental and helped me with coping strategies to get me through such a difficult time. Looking back on it now I do not know how I would have got to where I am now without her support and would recommend Maria Wilson and to anyone in a similar position as me.</a>

                                        I came to Julia struggling to understand the impact sexual abuse that had taken place in my 
                                        childhood had had on me. I knew there were things bubbling below the surface that were weaving 
                                        their way into how I formed relationships and the way I have behaved since I was a teenager,
                                         but I didn’t know what they were or how to deal with them. The hours I’ve spent working with 
                                         Julia have been the most valuable of my life. Not only did we form a trusting, patient 
                                         relationship, but she helped me slowly understand what had happened to me. 
                                         After [three] months of work I now feel equipped to do things differently. It’s been the most 
                                         liberating and empowering experience and I’ve learnt things that will stay with me forever. 
                                        Thank you Julia!

                                        I undertook 6 months of therapy with Oliver and its 6 months I believe has changed my life forever.
                                        He was professional, eloquent, and non-judgmental. I sought out therapy primarily to help 
                                        tackle my anxiety and to find someone who can help me understand my thought processes in a more
                                        coherent way. He educated me on the impact anxiety has on your body, where it comes from, 
                                        the scientific understanding of it and techniques to help manage it. His knowledge and 
                                        experience really shone through in every aspect of my sessions.

                                        I have struggled with OCD and anxiety since I was a child. Initially, I was quickly put on 
                                        medication as a stopgap but never dealt with the root issues. Oliver Moy was my first therapist. I made immense progress with Mita in just 2 years! I learned many 
                                        He told me the strategies and methods to deal with my anxiety, and gained much insight into myself and some 
                                        underlying issues stemming from my past. I now have greater awareness and control of my thought
                                        processes. Most of all, I have hope that one day I will leave these issues completely behind 
                                        me as I continue to get stronger.</div>

                                        He got what I needed straight away and through incisive but gentle questioning helped me 
                                        change the way I think about so many things. If you are thinking about talking to a therapist,
